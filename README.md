# Edbot
A simple discord bot built on Elixir.

## Installation
Clone this directory and then run:

```sh
mix deps.get
```

You need to set the environment variable for the Nostrum discord bot token in a `.env` file like so:

```
export NOSTRUM_TOKEN="TOKEN"
```

Then, simply run

```sh
iex -S mix
```

and the bot should be ready for interaction.
